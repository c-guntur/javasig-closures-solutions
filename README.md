## What is this source code for?
This source code is the initial content shared in the NYJavaSIG HelloJava workshop on Java 8 closures, lambdas and other related features introduced in Java 8.

## How will the code be used? 
Attendees attempt to fix the issues in each example to satisfy the ask in comments.

The intention is to learn about basic lambda syntax and other related Java 8 features through a set of examples.
